    "answer": "No, you are not telling the truth because your statement that everything you say is false contradicts itself; if it were true, then part of what you're saying would be true after all. This creates an inherent contradiction and means at least one aspect of this complex sentence must be a lie.",

    "answer": "Here's how to calculate the number of apples you have:\n- You start with 3 apples and eat 2, so that leaves you with 3 -  end your calculation as follows: If we follow the mathematical operations given in sequence while considering physical constraints (i.e., not eating or dropping more than what's logically possible), then after consuming all three of my initial apples and purchasing four new ones, I would have a total that equals 1 apple remaining. However, if one assumes the logical impossibility where it is physically conceivable to eat an entire inventory without replenishment (though not advisable for personal well-being), then mathematically you'd incorrectly arrive at -2 apples by prematurely subtracting 3 from 4. Therefore, taking realism into account and adhering strictly to the numbers given:",
